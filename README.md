# odin-recipes
Basic Recipe Website, the first public Odin Project project. This webpage presents three exclusive, very-limited, rustic foods that are cheaply made in a rented-out kitchen. Also there will be a gif above the recipes to distract from the clear lack of creativity for our dishes and their contents. Enjoy!
